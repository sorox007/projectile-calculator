# projectile-calculator
A quick simple way to depict the trajectory of a particle using Newton's laws using pyplot.

# Features
1. graph of the trajectory
2. Time of flight
3. Range
4. Maximum Height

# Python Libraries Used
1. matplotlib
2. numpy
3. math

As I'm using pyplot, I have taken 1000 points in the range to calculate the height at every point. The accuracy of the plot can hence be improved and everything can be tweaked.

Contributions are welcome! If you have any ideas to improve the application or find any issues, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
